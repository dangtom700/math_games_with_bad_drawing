# **INTRODUCTION**

This a project that is started purely on my own interest in writing code, practicing on algorithms and structures, and mathematical thinking. All of these are originally taken from thh book called "Math Games with Bad Drawings", written by Ben Orlin. There are some other ideas that I try to extend beyond his original ideas. They are very fun to look back. 

I want to say that even though I don't have any love or interest in pure mathematics but I'm into logical thinking and reasoning skills. Critical thinkng is definitely something I pick up a long the way. Therefore, I'm interested in what is underneath every mathematical equations: the logic. However, I also major in engineering so I'm interested in how to apply one euqation or one abitrary concept into practice, such as optimizing mechanical desgin, vectoring images, topylogy for modelling.
