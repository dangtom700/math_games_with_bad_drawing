    "This is a game found on page 142 under the section \"Number games\" in the book \"Math Games with Bad Drawings\", written by Ben Orlin. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Initial Idea\n",
    "This game has circulated for more than 50 years an excercise for programming, introductory level.\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin, write down all of the whole number up to some ceiling, such as 12. Then, each turn, claim a number, and add it to your score. The Tax Collector receive all of the remaining numbers that it divide evenly.\n",
    "\n",
    "The challenge is that the Tax Collector must receive something on every turn. Keep going until the only remaining numbers have no divisors left, at which point the Tax Collector gets them all. "

    "The game starts introducing a full number list in ascending order. For every round, the player has to choose a number in that list. There are two functions that check whether that number is within the given list and makes the tax collector happy. Then, thtx collector will automatically collect all the numbers that are divisible to the number player picked. The number player picked and the total tax collector collect every round will be added in end of each round to compare after the game ends. When the tax collector finishes his job, the game will ask whether the player want to continue the game. The next round is be started off with the remaining numbers in the same list."
