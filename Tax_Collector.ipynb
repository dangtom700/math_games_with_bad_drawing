    "This is a game found on page 142 under the section \"Number games\" in the book \"Math Games with Bad Drawings\", written by Ben Orlin. \n",

    "### Initial Idea\n",
    "This game has circulated for more than 50 years an excercise for programming, introductory level.\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin, write down all of the whole number up to some ceiling, such as 12. Then, each turn, claim a number, and add it to your score. The Tax Collector receive all of the remaining numbers that it divide evenly.\n",
    "\n",
    "The challenge is that the Tax Collector must receive something on every turn. Keep going until the only remaining numbers have no divisors left, at which point the Tax Collector gets them all. "
