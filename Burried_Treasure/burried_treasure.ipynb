    "This is a buffing game for honest people but sneaky in spirit. To begin, write letters A through I on individual scraps of paper. WIthout looking randomly give four scraps to one player. Then do the same for the number from 1 to 9. Keep them secret from your opponent. One number and one number will remain left over, which designates as where the treasure is burried\n",

    "- Ask your opponent if they hold a particular letter or number: they have to tell the truth\n",
    "- Propose a location to dig for the burried treasure: If your opponent holds either card, then they reply \"No treasure there\". If your opponent holds neither of the cards, they can say \"Actually, no treasure there\". If it's the second time saying that, they win the prize"
